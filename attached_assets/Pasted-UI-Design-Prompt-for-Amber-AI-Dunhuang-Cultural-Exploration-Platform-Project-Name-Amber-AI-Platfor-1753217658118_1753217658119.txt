UI Design Prompt for Amber AI: Dunhuang Cultural Exploration Platform
Project Name: Amber AI Platform Type: Web-based AI cultural learning platform

Objective: Design a visually engaging, intuitive, and culturally rich user interface for Amber AI that helps users explore the art, calligraphy, and spiritual background of Dunhuang through AI interaction. The design should balance traditional Chinese aesthetics with modern, clean usability for both casual learners and cultural researchers.

Main User Flow:
	1	Home section – Introduction and “Start Exploring” button
	2	Question Input Section – User types a general/specific question
	3	AI Response Section – Response presented in multiple logical sections
	4	Follow-up Questions Section – Suggested questions + clickable answers
	5	Settings/Language Section – English / 中文

Visual Style Guidelines:
	•	Theme: Inspired by Dunhuang art (e.g., cave murals, silk road elements, Buddhist motifs)
	•	Color palette:
	◦	Earth tones: terracotta, sand beige, cave brown
	◦	Accent colors: turquoise blue, lotus pink, gold
